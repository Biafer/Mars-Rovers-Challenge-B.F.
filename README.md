# Mars-Rovers-Challenge-B.F.
It is an application that moves the Mars rover using the commands "M", "R", "L" and "B" of your keyboard.
The letter "M" means move forward, that on the application is upper movimentation, the letter "R" means move to the right side, the letter "L" means move to the left side and the letter "B" was created to move backward, that means a down movimantation.

Platform eclipse java WAS used to develop this application.

Performance tests:
First a command was used to test the program: System.out.println("OK");
Afterwards, it was necessary to discover the code of the keyboard letters: System.out.println(e.getKeyCode());
After had discovered the codes, the move of rover was created. To test the perfomance of the moving, the button "Run APPMarsRovers" was pressed and "M", "R", "L" and "B" was also pressed to see the movement happen.
